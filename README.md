# AutoCorrect

Install AutoHotKey on your computer to use this, and make sure to put the icons in the same directory as the .ahk script.

Keybinds:

Win + A to add an automatic entry

Win + M to add a manual entry

Win + ? to add a mid text manual entry

Win + P to pause the script

When adding an entry, highlight the word you want to put in the script and then press the appropriate keybind, depending on which kind of entry it should be.
Type the correct spelling of the word on the far right hand side of what's in the box. Everything you see in the box will be directly added to the script, at the bottom
of the list.

Entry guide:

Automatic entries will correct once you type the last letter of the misspelled word. For example, ohno will only correct to oh no once you type the last o.
Manual entries will correct once you press the space bar. For example, ohyes will only correct to oh yes when you type out ohyes and press space.
Mid text automatic entries will correct just like manual entries, the only difference being it will correct inside of other texts. For example, maybeso will correct once
you press space to maybe so, but will also correct ohmaybeso to ohmaybe so.
